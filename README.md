# BACHELOR SEMESTER PROJECT 3
## BERT and Relation Extraction: Comparative Analysis

The following describes the technical and scientific deliverable of the Bachelor Semester Project 3 (BSP3) of the student Tarik Tornes,
which was created under the supervision of his Project Academic Tutor Prof. Martin Theobald.
The focus of this work relies on the Transformer Architecture and its usage for the Natural Language Processing downstream task of Relation Extraction.
The project is subdivided into a scientific part, explaining the concept of the transformer architecture, and the technical part which makes use of the Transformer on RE and evaluates the performance and analyses the results.
